# C002. 📚 C Programming – Notes and Concepts

---

## 1. Data Type Notes

- `int` and `long` can be the same size (e.g., 32-bit), depending on **compiler setup** and **configuration**, even on 64-bit systems.
- Use `<limits.h>` to check ranges like `INT_MIN`, `INT_MAX`, `LONG_MIN`, `LONG_MAX`.
- Compilers (GCC, MSVC) may default to 32-bit types unless explicitly configured.

### ✅ Initializing `long` in C

```c
long myLong = 123456789L;  // Use 'L' suffix for clarity
```

### ✅ Type Declaration Validity

| Type            | Valid?  | Description                        |
|-----------------|---------|------------------------------------|
| `long long`     | ✅ Yes  | Usually 64-bit, larger than `long` |
| `double double` | ❌ No   | Invalid type in C                  |
| `long double`   | ✅ Yes  | High-precision floating-point type |

---

#### ✅ Declare Literals

- **Use `LL` or `ll`** for `long long` literals:  

  ```c
  long long a = 1235456789LL;
  ```

- **Use `L`** for `long double` literals:  

  ```c
  long double b = 1234567.89012L;
  ```

#### 📥 Input and 📤 Output Format Specifiers

- **`%lld`** for `long long`:

  ```c
  scanf("%lld", &a);
  printf("Value = %lld\n", a);
  ```

- **`%Lf`** for `long double`:

  ```c
  scanf("%Lf", &b);
  printf("Value = %Lf\n", b);
  ```

---

## 2. Sequence Control Instructions

Defines **flow of execution** in code:

1. **Sequential Execution** – Runs line-by-line.
2. **Branching** –
   - *Conditional*: `if`, `else`, `switch`, `JZ`, `JNZ`
   - *Unconditional*: `goto`, `JMP`
3. **Looping** – `for`, `while`, `do...while`
4. **Subroutine Calls** – `function()`, `CALL`, `RET`

---

## 3. Assignment Examples

✅ Valid:

```c
z = b * a;
```

❌ Invalid:

```c
b * a = z;  // Can't assign to an expression
```

---

## 4. Computer Math is Different

- ❗ No implicit multiplication:

```c
printf("The value of 4 * 5 is %d\n", 4.5);    // ❌ wrong specifier
printf("The value of 4 * 5 is %d\n", (4)(5)); // ❌ invalid syntax
printf("The value of a * b = %f\n", ab);      // ❌ 'ab' isn't a valid variable
```

---

## 5. Exponentiation

- ⚠️ C **does not** support `^` as power operator (`^` is bitwise XOR)

Use:

```c
#include <math.h>
pow(a, b);  // ✅ Correct way
```

---

## 6. Operator Associativity (Left to Right)

```c
8 * 2 / 3 * 2
= 16 / 3 * 2
= 5 * 2
= 10
```

But with brackets:

```c
(8 * 2) / (3 * 2) = 16 / 6 = 2
```

---

## 7. Primitive vs Non-Primitive Types

| Type Category | Examples                                             |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Primitive     | `int`, `char`, `float`, `bool`                       |
| Non-Primitive | `Array`, `Struct`, `Union`, `Pointer`, `Linked List` |

### 🛆 Arrays

- Type: Non-primitive
- Memory: Contiguous
- Size: Fixed during declaration

### 🧵 Linked Lists (Detailed in Data Structures repo)

- Type: Non-primitive
- Memory: Dynamic
- Size: Flexible at runtime

## 8. ✨ Character vs Integer

| Input | Type         | Explanation                      |
|-------|--------------|----------------------------------|
| `'2'` | Character ✅ | ASCII value 50                   |
| `21`  | Integer   ❌ | Two-digit number                 |
| `'-'` | Character ✅ | ASCII value 45                   |
| `-2`  | Integer   ❌ | Negative number, not a character |

### ☞ Tips

- Anything in `'single quotes'` → **character**
- Anything outside quotes → **number**

# CP002. Data Types Trivia

*A quick guide on how to initialize doubles, use scientific notation, and understand type promotion in C!*

## 1. Initialize Double

You can initialize a `double` variable in several ways:

### ➡️ Direct Initialization

```c
double myDouble = 3.14159;
```

---

### ➡️ Using Type Casting

```c
double myDouble = (double)3.14159;
```

---

### ➡️ Using Scientific Notation (Exponential form)

#### Validity Check: [digits].[digits]e[+/-]digits

```c
double myDouble = 1.23e4;    // Equivalent to 1.23 × 10⁴ = 12300
double anotherDouble = 12e4; // Equivalent to 12 × 10⁴ = 120000
```

- `e` or `E` means "**times 10 raised to**."
- Example: `3e12` means `3 × 10¹²`.

✅ Some valid forms:

```c
double d1 = 5e0;    // 5.0
double d2 = 6.7e-2; // 0.067
double d3 = 2.;     // 2.0
double d4 = .5;     // 0.5
```

❌ Invalid:

```c
double wrong = 4.5e.3;  // ❌ error: decimal after 'e' not allowed
wrong = 23e54E45;       // ❌ error: only one 'e' is allowed
wrong = 5e4e;           // ❌ error: only one 'e' is allowed
wrong = 6e;             // ❌ error: exponent is missing
wrong = .;              // ❌ error: not a number
wrong = .e5;            // ❌ error: not a number
wrong = E;              // ❌ error: will be treated as char
```

---

### ➡️ Using Constants

```c
#include <float.h>
double myDouble = DBL_MAX;   // Maximum value for double
double smallDouble = DBL_MIN; // Smallest positive normalized double
```

---

### ➡️ Initializing with Other Variables

```c
int myInt = 42;
double myDouble = myInt;  // Auto-implicit promotion from int to double
double d2 = myDouble;     // ✅
```

---

### ➡️ Special Floating-Point Values

You can work with *special double values*:

| Value                 | Meaning                                |
|:----------------------|:---------------------------------------|
| `+inf` or `INFINITY`  | Positive infinity (`1.0 / 0.0`)        |
| `-inf`                | Negative infinity (`-1.0 / 0.0`)       |
| `NaN` (Not a Number)  | Indeterminate value (`0.0 / 0.0`)      |

Example:

```c
#include <math.h>

double pos_inf = INFINITY;
double neg_inf = -INFINITY;
double not_a_number = NAN;
```

---

## 2. What is Type Promotion?

**Type promotion** happens when a smaller data type is automatically converted to a larger one during:

- Assignments
- Calculations (expressions)
- Function calls

It **avoids loss of precision** when mixing types.

✅ Example:

```c
int a = 5;
double b = a;  // 'a' promoted to double automatically
```

✅ Another Example:

```c
int a = 5;
float b = 2.5f;
double result = a + b;  // 'a' and 'b' promoted to double
```

---

## 3. ⚡ Quick C Type Promotion Rules

| If you mix...        | Then C promotes... | Example                 |
|:---------------------|:-------------------|:------------------------|
| `char` and `int`     | ➔ `int`           | `'a' + 1` ➔ int        |
| `short` and `int`    | ➔ `int`           | `short + int` ➔ int    |
| `int` and `float`    | ➔ `float`         | `5 + 2.5f` ➔ float     |
| `int` and `double`   | ➔ `double`        | `5 + 2.5` ➔ double     |
| `float` and `double` | ➔ `double`        | `2.5f + 3.14` ➔ double |

✨ **Golden Rule: "Bigger wins!"**

---

## 4. 🎯 Final Shortcuts and Ranges

| Type          | Approximate Range          |
|:--------------|:---------------------------|
| `float`       | ~ ±3.4 × 10³⁸              |
| `double`      | ~ ±1.7 × 10³⁰⁸             |
| `long double` | Even larger (compiler-dependent) |

---

### 🔥 Fun Tip

- `15.e45` ➔ Valid (`15.0 × 10^45`)
- `45e.45` ➔ ❌ Invalid (must be `45e2` or `45e-2`, not decimal after `e`)

---

# C004. More on Loops

## 1. Entry Control Loop vs Exit Control Loop  

✅ **Entry Control Loop** → **Condition is checked first, then the loop runs.**  
✅ **Exit Control Loop** → **Loop runs at least once, then checks the condition.**

---

### Examples

- **Entry Control Loops** (Condition checked **before** execution)  
  - `for`  
  - `while`  

- **Exit Control Loop** (Condition checked **after** execution)  
  - `do-while`  

💡 *`do-while`* is the only exit control loop in C. Everything else is entry control!

---

## 2. How Condition Checking Works in C

- In any `if`, ternary (`? :`), or loop statement,  
  - **Any non-zero value** is treated as **`true`**.
  - **0** is treated as **`false`**.

### Example

```c
if (1) // true
    printf("This will run!");

if (0) // false
    printf("This won't run!");
```

---

## 3. ⚠️ Be Careful: Infinite Loop Trap

Sometimes beginners accidentally cause infinite loops by missing proper initialization or condition checks.

### Tricky Example

```c
for (int i; i; )
{
    // Infinite loop! because 'i' is uninitialized (random garbage value)
}
```

- Here, `i` contains an unknown value, which might be nonzero, causing the loop to never end!

---

## 4. ✨ Why `while(*p)` works?

This is a classic C idiom used when working with strings.

### 🎯 Example

```c
char *p = "hello";
while (*p)
{
    printf("%c\n", *p);
    p++;
}
```

✅ **Why it stops:**  

- Strings end with a **null character (`'\0'`)**, which is value **0**.
- `*p` reads the current character.
- So `while (*p)` means: “Run until the current character is not `'\0'`.”

⛔ When `*p` becomes `'\0'`, the loop stops automatically.

---

## 5. ✨ `for (i = 0; 0; i++)` — Will `i` still become 0?

Yes! As the **initialization part of a `for` loop always executes** before the condition is checked.

### Think of it as: `for` (`Init;` → `Condition;` → `Update`) → `{`...`}`

### ⚔️ Example

```c
int i = 5;
for (i = 0; 0; i++)
{
    // This will never run!
}
printf("%d", i); // Output: 0
```

✅ Even though the loop doesn’t run, `i = 0` **still happens**.  
💡 The **condition (0)** is false, so the loop body and `i++` are skipped, but the **init runs anyway**.

# C005. 📘 `factorial(n)` – Explained Step-by-Step

```c
int factorial(int n)
{
    if (n < 2) return 1; // Base case
    
    return n * factorial(n - 1); // Recursive case
}
```

---

## 🧱 Function Structure Breakdown

### 1. **Function Definition**

```c
int factorial(int n)
```

- Declares a function named `factorial` that takes an integer `n`.
- Returns an `int` — the factorial result.

---

### 2. **Base Case**

```c
if (n < 2) return 1;
```

- If `n` is `0` or `1`, it returns `1`.
- This **stops** the recursion from going on forever — it’s the "exit door".

---

### 3. **Recursive Case**

```c
return n * factorial(n - 1);
```

- Function calls **itself** with `n - 1`.
- Builds up a chain like this:  
  `factorial(4) = 4 * factorial(3)`  
  `factorial(3) = 3 * factorial(2)`  
  ...until it hits the base case.

---

## 🔁 Recursion Flow Example (`factorial(4)`)

```c
factorial(4)
→ 4 * factorial(3)
    → 3 * factorial(2)
        → 2 * factorial(1)
            → return 1 at factorial(1) (base case hit)
        → returns 2 * factorial(1) = 2 * 1
    → returns 3 * 2 = 6
→ returns 4 * 6 = 24
```

---

## 📝 Summary

- Recursion is like stacking calls, then solving them backward. [`DOWN` to `UP`]
- The **base case** ends the recursion.
- The **recursive case** breaks the problem down.

---

## ✨ Short Tip

- Using **function prototypes** along with function definitions is a *good practice* in C, as it improves code clarity, program organization and helps the compiler catch errors early!

- In C, it's better to return `0` and `1` for `true/false` values rather than using boolean types like `true` or `false`. Some compilers might not support them, and in the end, conditions are evaluated as integers (`0` for `false` and anything `non-zero` for `true`).

---

# CP005. `nth` Fibonacci Number by Recursion

That function is designed to calculate the **nth Fibonacci number** using recursion.

---

## 1. Base Case

If `n` is 0 or 1, it simply returns `n`. This stops the recursion from going on forever.

```c
if (n <= 1) {
    return n;
}
```

---

## 2. Recursive Case

For any number greater than 1, the function calls itself to calculate the two previous Fibonacci numbers and adds them together.

```c
return calculate(n - 1) + calculate(n - 2);
```

This continues until it reaches the base cases. Once it does, the values start returning back up the chain like puzzle pieces coming together.

---

## Example: `calculate(5)`

It works kind of like solving a puzzle step by step:

### Going down ⬇️

- `calculate(5)`: Calculates `calculate(4) + calculate(3)`
  - `calculate(4)`: Calculates `calculate(3) + calculate(2)`
    - `calculate(3)`: Calculates `calculate(2) + calculate(1)`
      - `calculate(2)`: Calculates `calculate(1) + calculate(0)`
        - `calculate(1)`: Returns 1 (base case)
        - `calculate(0)`: Returns 0 (base case)

### Now going up ⬆️

- Sum of `calculate(1) + calculate(0)`: 1 + 0 = 1
- `calculate(2)`: Returns 1 (base case)
- `calculate(3)`: Returns 2 (sum of `calculate(2) + calculate(1)`) [1 + 1]
- `calculate(4)`: Returns 3 (sum of `calculate(3) + calculate(2)`)  [2 + 1]
- `calculate(5)`: Returns 5 (sum of `calculate(4) + calculate(3)`)   [3 + 2]

So, `calculate(5)` returns **5** – the 5th Fibonacci number!

---

## 💡Tip 1: Think of it like unfolding a math formula step by step — recursion breaks the problem into smaller versions of itself

---

## 💡Tip 2: You can only pass actual **values** or **function calls** that return values, like

```c
printf("%d", calculate(n));
```

- It **doesn’t** pick up values from future lines or other `printf()`s:

  ```c
  printf("%d");      // ❌ No value given — undefined behavior
  printf(42);        // ❌ Invalid, no format specifier
  printf("%d", 42);  // ✅ Perfect, expects an integer argument right there
  ```

# C007. 📘 Array Notes

---

## 1. 📌 Array to Pointer Decay

In C, when you declare an array like `int marks[5];`, the array name `marks` represents the **address of the first element** — i.e., `&marks[0]`.

So, these two are functionally **equivalent**:

```c
int *ptr = marks;
int *ptr = &marks[0];
```

This automatic conversion is called **array-to-pointer decay** — it happens when an array is used in expressions or passed to functions.

---

## 2. 📥 Passing Arrays to Functions

When you pass an array to a function like this:

```c
void printArray(int ptr[], int n);
```

It’s **equivalent** to:

```c
void printArray(int *ptr, int n);
```

Why? Because arrays **decay into pointers** when passed to functions. So both forms mean the function receives a pointer to the first element of the array.

You can then use `ptr[i]` or pointer arithmetic like `*(ptr + i)` to access each element.

### ✅ Example

```c
printf("Element %d | value: %d\n", i + 1, ptr[i]);
```

---

## 3. 📍 How Array Element Address is Calculated

The address of the `n`th element in an array is calculated like this:

```text
address = base_address + (n * size_of_each_element)
```

### Example

If an array starts at address `62302` and each `int` is `4` bytes:

```text
2nd element address = 62302 + 2 * 4 = 62310
```

### Code Form

```c
int *ptr = arr + n; // Not multiplied by sizeof, as pointer math handles it
```

> ❗ Don't do `arr + n * sizeof(arr[0])` — **pointer arithmetic already uses the element size internally**.

🧠 **Note**: `arr` already points to `&arr[0]`.  
So `arr + 1` points to the next element automatically — **no need to manually multiply by size!**

---

## 4. 🤔 `i + 1` vs `i++` in `printf`

Let’s look at this line:

```c
printf("Student %d | marks in subject %d is: %d\n", i + 1, j + 1, marks[i][j]);
```

- `i + 1` and `j + 1` are **just expressions**. They compute values based on the current `i` and `j` but do **not** change their original values.
- If you want to actually change `i` or `j`, use `i++` or `j++` (post-increment) or `++i` (pre-increment).

📝 **Tip:** Use `i + 1` for **display purposes** (like showing Student 1 instead of Student 0), and `i++` if you actually want to update `i`.

---

## 5. 🌟 `%nd` Formatting Trick in `printf`

- `n` → means **minimum width**, the number will be **right-aligned**.
- `d` → means it's an integer.

### Example: `%-2d`

- `2` → is **minimum width**.
- `-` → means **left-align** the number within that width.

```c
printf("Student %-2d | Marks: %d", s, m);
```

```text
Student 1  | Marks: 78
Student 10 | Marks: 90
```

🧹 Helps keep things aligned neatly when numbers grow.

Try:

- Left-align: `%-3d`
- Right-align: `%2d`
and see the difference in layout!

# C007. C Size Notes

---

## 1. `%d` vs `%u` Specifier

| Format Specifier | Works With     | Accepts Negative? | Extra Step Needed?   |
|------------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| `%d`             | `int`          | ✅ Yes            | ❌ No               |
| `%u`             | `unsigned int` | ❌ No             | ✅ Yes (conversion) |

### When to Use

- Use `%d` if output is always non-negative → **faster and simpler**.
- Use `%u` only when you're specifically dealing with `unsigned int`.

### Example

```c
int result = 100;
printf("%d\n", result); // Simpler and faster
```

---

## 2. What is `sizeof`?

- It **returns the size** of any object **in bytes**.
- **Retrieves the size** of different data types and variables **based on your architecture**.

### Use Case?

- Perform **size-related operations** like *storing length of an array.*

```c
size_t length = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]); // arr length = total arr size / each element size
```

#### Example: `sizeof(int), sizeof(float)`, etc

---

## 3. What is `size_t`?

- `size_t` is a **special unsigned number** used in C to **count things** – like *how many toys in a box* 📦 or *letters in a word* 🔤
- You can't have -5 toys, right? That's why **it can’t be negative**.
- The computer uses it to **know how big something is**, or **how many times** to do something safely (especially in loops, arrays, and memory management).

### 👩‍💻 Behind the Scenes

- `size_t` is an **unsigned data type** that stores **size values in bytes**.
- It is the **return type of `sizeof`** and used in functions like `malloc()`, `strlen()`, etc.
- It is **defined in**:
  - `stddef.h`
  - `stdio.h`
  - `stdlib.h`
  - and some other standard headers!

> 🖥️ On a 32-bit system → usually `unsigned int`  
> 💻 On a 64-bit system → usually `unsigned long`

---

### 🔹 Why use `size_t`?

- **Architecture-compatible** (safe for both 32-bit and 64-bit systems).
- **No negatives** (perfect for sizes, memory allocation, and indexing).
- **Safer and portable** coding standard.

---

### 🔹 Basic Use

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    size_t count;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%zu", &count);  // %zu = correct format specifier for size_t
    printf("You entered: %zu\n", count);
}
```

---

### 🔹 Smart Input Handling

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    long input;
    scanf("%ld", &input);

    if (input < 0) input = -input; // Auto-correct negative inputs
    size_t count = (size_t)input;  // Safe conversion

    printf("Final count: %zu\n", count);
}
```

## 4. ✨ Bonus Tip: About `NULL`

- `NULL` is a special constant that represents a **zero memory address** (nothing/empty pointer).
- **It is also defined** in:
  - `stddef.h`
  - `stdio.h`
  - `stdlib.h`
  - `string.h`
- So just like `size_t`, **you often get `NULL` automatically** with standard headers.

# CP007. Pointer and Loops Dilemma

---

## 1. 📌 Pointer Trivia — A Pointer Has Its Own Address

- `ptr` holds an address → `int *ptr = &arr[0];`
- `&ptr` is the pointer’s own address.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[3] = {10, 20, 30};
    int *ptr = arr;

    printf("ptr (points to arr[0]) = %p\n", (void *)ptr);
    printf("&ptr (address of ptr) = %p\n", (void *)&ptr);
}
```

### Sample Output

ptr (points to arr[0]) = 0x7ffeefbff4b0
&ptr (address of ptr)  = 0x7ffeefbff4b8

> Even pointers are stored somewhere! Notice how `ptr` and `&ptr` are different!

---

## 2. ➿ Loop Iterator Dilemma: `int i;` Outside vs `int i = 0;` Inside?

Ever wondered whether you should initialize iterator only once for every loops:

```c
int i;
for (i = 0; i < n; i++) ...
```

or go clean with:

```c
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) ...
```

Let’s solve this with a fun **peon analogy** 😄

---

### 🤖 The Peon Analogy

#### 📦 `int i;` outside the loop

> 🧑‍🏭 Think of a **permanent peon** sitting at a far-away desk.  
> Every time you run a loop, you're like:  
> "Hey peon, go to that address, set that value to 0, and start counting!"

- The variable `i` lives *somewhere else*, and the compiler must keep referring back to that same spot.
- If code is long, `i` *drifts further away* from where it's needed — e.g. you work for Africa and live at North Pole.
- Possible side effect: Forgeting you used `i` elsewhere, leading to bugs.

---

#### ⚡ `int i = 0;` inside the loop

> 🎯 This time, it's like hiring a **temporary peon** right where the work happens:  
> "Hey you! I have a small task — start from 0, finish it, and leave."

- The variable is created *right next to the loop*, making it **more local and faster to reach**.
- The compiler treats it like:  

> *"Cool, it's right here. I can optimize this and reuse registers smartly!"*

- Cleaner and avoids unintended reuse across unrelated loops.

---

### 🔍 What About Code Size?

> Every time you think local peons = bloated code… think again!

- 🧠 Modern compilers are **clever**.
- Both styles **compile** to **almost the same size**.
- With compiler optimizations (`-O2`, `-O3`), **there's no size bloat** using `int i` inside the loop.

*Unless you write performance-critical code on limited hardware*, this is nothing to worry about.

---

## ✅ Summary

| Style                | Speed        | Clean Code | Code Size |
|----------------------|:------------:|:----------:|:---------:|
| `int i;` outside     | ✅ okay     | ❌ clutter | ✅ same   |
| `int i = 0;` inside  | ✅ faster   | ✅ cleaner | ✅ same-ish |

> Use **`for (int i = 0;`** — it’s like hiring a local peon for each task.  
> Better scoped, easier to manage, and **modern compilers love it**.  
> Unless you *have a reason*, **don’t hire a full-time peon for a 5-sec job!**

> Written by someone who once believed the peon got tired running back and forth too much.

# C008. String Notes in C

---

## 1. 📚 Quick Definitions

- **Buffer**: A chunk of **temporary memory** to store input (like `char name[20]`) generally from terminal.
- **Bounds**: The **limit** of how much the buffer can hold (e.g., 20 characters).
- **Signed**: Variables storing **both** negative and positive values (e.g., `-10` to `+10`).
- **Unsigned**: Variables storing **only positive values** (e.g., `0` to `255`), useful for safe character handling.

---

## 2. 🧵 String Input in C – The Safe Way

### 🚫 Avoid This: `gets(name);`

```c
gets(name);
```

- **Problem**: It **doesn’t check** buffer size.
- **Risk**: **Buffer Overflow** → leads to **memory corruption**.

### ✅ Use This Instead: `fgets(name, sizeof(name), stdin);`

```c
fgets(name, sizeof(name), stdin);
```

| Part             | Meaning                             |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| name             | Where input is stored               |
| sizeof(name)     | Max characters to accept            |
| stdin            | Keyboard input (standard input)     |

✅ **Safe** for handling string inputs without crash.

---

## 3. 🔎 About isspace((unsigned char)ch)

```c
while (isspace((unsigned char)ch))
```

- Checks if a character is **space**, **tab**, or **newline**.
- ✅ Cast to `unsigned char` to prevent problems on systems where `char` is signed.

---

## 4. 🔡 `tolower()` and `toupper()` in C

### ✨ Usage

- `tolower(c)` → Converts uppercase to lowercase.
- `toupper(c)` → Converts lowercase to uppercase.
- If already the correct case → **no change**.

```c
char ch = 'A';
ch = tolower(ch); // Now ch is 'a'
```

✅ Always **assign back** if you want to **keep the change**.

---

## 5. 🎯 getchar() and putchar() — Basic I/O

---

### 📥 getchar()

- Reads **one character** at a time from keyboard.
- Stores it as **int** to handle `EOF`.
- **If user just presses Enter** → reads a newline (`'\n'`) — no error!
- **EOF happens only if**:
  - User presses `Ctrl+D` (Linux/macOS) or `Ctrl+Z` (Windows).
  - Input error occurs (rare).

#### Example

```c
int ch = getchar();
if (ch == '\n')
    printf("You pressed Enter!\n");
else if (ch == EOF)
    printf("EOF detected!\n");
else
    printf("You entered: %c\n", ch);
```

---

### 📤 putchar()

- Prints **one character** to screen.

```c
putchar('A'); // Prints A
```

- Simple and fast way to print small outputs.

---

## 6. 🚨 EOF Handling Tip

If you really want to **check for bad input**:

- Always store `getchar()` result into an `int`.
- Check if it's `EOF` before processing.
- Clear buffer properly if needed (we'll discuss more in `cp8_notes.md`).

---

## 7. 🛡️ `ctype.h` Functions Work on `int` Too

- Functions like `tolower()`, `toupper()`, `isspace()`, `isalpha()`, etc., **expect an `int`**, **not** `char`.
- ✅ **Recommended** to pass an `int` because:
  - `getchar()` returns `int` (to handle `EOF` properly).
  - Safer with user inputs and prevents unexpected behavior.
- They internally check if the value is a valid character or `EOF`.
- **Example** with `tolower()`:

```c
int ch = tolower(getchar()); // int and lowercase
if (ch == 'y') 
    printf("You said yes!\n");
else if (ch == 'n')
    printf("You said no!\n");
```

---

# 🔥 CP008: Input Buffer Clearing + String Tricks (Best Practices)

## 1. ✅ Why Clear the Input Buffer?

- `scanf("%[^\n]", ...)` **stops at `\n`**, but **leaves `\n` in the buffer**.
- Next input (`scanf("%c", &c)`) picks that leftover `\n` 😩 — and behaves weirdly.

---

## 2. ✅ Best Ways to Clear Input Buffer

---

### 🛡️ **General Method** — Safe and Easy

```c
int ch;
while ((ch = getchar()) != '\n' && ch != EOF);
```

- Classic, super clear to read.
- Best for occasional buffer clearing.

---

### ⚡ **When You Need It Often** — Cleaner and Faster

#### 🧹 **Readable One-Liner**

```c
for (int c = getchar(); c != '\n' && c != EOF; c = getchar());
```

- Neat, beginner-friendly, and easy to debug.

#### ✨ **Short & Crisp Version**

```c
for (int c; (c = getchar()) != '\n' && c != EOF; );
```

- Slightly shorter.
- Cool for minimalistic coders!

---

✅ All of these:

- Clear everything until a newline (`\n`) or **end of file** (`EOF`).
- Are **simple**, **portable**, and **safe** across platforms!

---

## 3. 🌟 `getchar()` — Explained Simply

- **Reads one char at a time** from the buffer.
- Also **removes** it.
- Keeps going in a loop → until it sees `\n` (Enter key).

### Why `int` and Not `char`?

1. **`getchar()` Returns an `int`**:

   - `getchar()` also signals when input ends using **EOF** (a special integer constant usually `-1`, not a regular character).
   - `char` can’t store `EOF` properly, so use **`int ch`**.

2. **Storing `EOF` Safely**:

   - `int` can hold **all characters** (ASCII 0–255) plus the special **EOF**.

3. **Avoiding Bugs**:

   - If `ch` were a `char`, `EOF` could be misinterpreted as a valid character.

4. **Comparison `ch != '\n'` works fine**:

   - `'\n'` is treated as an **int** by the compiler (ASCII 10).
   - C **promotes** it automatically for comparison.

---

### Simple Visualization

1. You type: `hello<Enter>`

   - The buffer has:

     ```text
     h e l l o \n
     ```

2. First `getchar()` call:

   - Reads `'h'` and removes it.
   - Buffer becomes:

     ```text
     e l l o \n
     ```

3. Second `getchar()` call:

   - Reads `'e'` and removes it.
   - Buffer becomes:

     ```text
     l l o \n
     ```

4. Continues until `getchar()` reads `\n`. The loop stops because `ch != '\n'` is **false**.

---

## 4. 🚫 Do NOT Use `fflush(stdin);`

- **Undefined** input stream behaviour in Standard C.
- Works **only on some compilers** (e.g., MSVC), fails on others.
- Not portable, not safe — **avoid** unless you *know* your environment.

---

## 5. 💡 `strcspn()` – Superpower String Tool

```c
strcspn(string, "\n")
```

- **Finds the index** of the first match from `"\n"` in the string.
- Helps you **remove `\n` from `fgets()`**:

```c
str[strcspn(str, "\n")] = '\0';
```

🔸 This replaces the first `\n` with `\0` (null terminator).
🔸 A **clean** way to strip trailing newline after `fgets()`.

### ❓ What if there is **no** newline?

If `\n` is **not found**, `strcspn` returns the **length of the string**.

Then this happens:

```c
str[length_of_str] = '\0';
```

But the last character at `str[length_of_str]` is **already** `\0` — the string terminator.

So you're just writing `\0` again in the same place. **No harm at all.** ✅ **Safe**.

# CP009. Compound Literals and Designated Initialization Notes

---

## Compound Literals 🍜

Think of **compound literals** as the **instant noodles** of C programming — quick, convenient, and you don’t bother naming them. Just mix, use, done!🌟

### 🎯 Example

```c
struct Point {
    int x, y;
};

// Without compound literals you declare and name it
struct Point p;
p.x = 10;
p.y = 20;
```

Now the compound literal magic:

```c
// With compound literals — just like instant noodles 🍜
struct Point p = (struct Point){10, 20};
```

No need to separately define a variable first — it's quick and direct.

---

## Designated or Normal or Standard Aggregate Initialization

It's just like **compound literals** but works only during declaring a variable.

### ✅ Example

```c
struct Point {
    int x, y;
};

// Standard Aggregate Initialization — just like instant noodles 🍜
struct Point p = {10, 20};
```

---

## Why They’re Awesome

✅ Great for **temporary** or **one-time-use** objects
✅ Perfect for functions like `initialize()` where you might do:

```c
typedef struct {
    int day;
    int month;
    int year;
} date;

date d = (date){0}; // resets all fields to 0 instantly
```

As if you wrote:

```c
date d = { .day = 0, .month = 0, .year = 0 };
```

Basically, **no-name, no-fuss structures** when you just need it *right now*.

---

## 💡 Partial Initialization Behavior in C

C initializes **in order** of declaration. Any **unspecified values** → get **set to 0**.

So:

```c
date d = {a, b, c};
```

Just maps to:

```c
day = a;
month = b;
year = c;
```

### ✨ Example

If you initialize only part of a struct, the rest is automatically set to `0`.

```c
typedef struct {
    int day;
    int month;
    int year;
} date;
```

| Code                     | Result                             |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `date d = {0};`          | day = 0, month = 0, year = 0 ✅    |
| `date d = {10};`         | day = 10, month = 0, year = 0 ✅   |
| `date d = {10, 20};`     | day = 10, month = 20, year = 0 ✅  |
| `date d = {10, 20, 30};` | day = 10, month = 20, year = 30 ✅ |

Missing fields are filled with `0` — super handy and clean!

---

## ✅ Why Compound Literals Rock

```c
date d = {10, 10};                // ✅ Fine at declaration
d = (date){11, 12};               // ✅ Reassignment using compound literal

d = {11, 12};                     // ❌ Error: Not allowed outside declaration

date *ptr = &(date){10, 20, 30};  // ✅ Creates a temporary unnamed struct and gives you its address

&(date d = {10, 20, 30});         // ❌ Can't do this
date d = &{10, 20, 30};           // ❌ Not allowed
```

Compound literals = **flexible**, **clean**, and **perfect for temporary needs** ✨

---

## ❓ `Compound Literals` vs `Aggregate Initialization`

| Situation                      | Compound Literals | Aggregate Initialization |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| At declaration                 | ✅ Valid          | ✅ Valid                |
| After declaration (assignment) | ✅ Valid          | ❌ Not allowed          |
| Temporary struct in function   | ✅ Very useful    | ❌ Not usable           |
| Can take address of result     | ✅ Yes            | ❌ No                   |

# ✍️ CP010. Formatted Output in C

Welcome to a mini refresher on two cool I/O functions: `fprintf` & `snprintf`. Think of them as twins with different destinations — one writes to files, the other to strings.

---

## 📁 1. `fprintf()` — *Formatted Writing to a File*

Just like `printf()` writes to your screen, `fprintf()` writes formatted text to a file (or any stream).

### Syntax

```c
fprintf(FILE *stream, const char *format, ...);
```

- `stream`: Destination (e.g., a file pointer like `fptr`, or `stdout`).
- `format`: Format string (e.g., `"Score: %d\n"`).
- `...`: Values to fill into the format string.

### ✅ Example

```c
FILE *fptr = fopen("output.txt", "w");
if (fptr) {
    fprintf(fptr, "Hello, %s! You scored %d points.\n", "Dipsana", 98);
    fclose(fptr);
}
```

📄 **Output inside `output.txt`:**

```text
Hello, Dipsana! You scored 98 points.
```

> 🔥 Great for: Logging, saving data, creating reports, and more.

---

## 🧵 2. `snprintf()` — *Formatted Writing to a String*

This function is used when you want to create a string in memory — kind of like building a message quietly without showing or saving it immediately.

### ✅ Syntax

```c
int snprintf(char *str, size_t size, const char *format, ...);
```

- `str`: The destination string (your memory buffer).
- `size`: Max size of the buffer (to avoid overflows).
- `format`: Format string.
- `...`: Values to insert.

---

### ✅ Example 1: Store a Message in a String

```c
char buffer[50];
snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), "Hello, %s! You scored %d points.", "Dipsana", 98);
printf("%s\n", buffer);
```

🖥️ **Output:**

```text
Hello, Dipsana! You scored 98 points.
```

---

### ✅ Example 2: Create Dynamic Filenames

```c
int n = 5;
char filename[20];
snprintf(filename, sizeof(filename), "emp%d.txt", n); // -> "emp5.txt"

FILE *ptr = fopen(filename, "w");
if (ptr) {
    fprintf(ptr, "This file is for employee number %d.\n", n);
    fclose(ptr);
}
```

📁 This will create a file named `emp5.txt` and write to it.

> 🧡 `snprintf` shines when you need to dynamically generate filenames, log entries, or formatted strings before using them.

---

## 🔁 Quick Comparison Table

| 🧩 **Feature**        | 📝 **`fprintf`**                           | 🧵 **`snprintf`**                      |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Writes to**          | A file or stream (`FILE *`)                | A character array (`char[]`)            |
| **Goes to screen?**    | Only if `stdout` is used                   | No — unless manually printed            |
| **Where it stores?**   | External destination (file, console, etc.) | Internal — builds a string in memory    |
| **Use-case**           | Logging, reports, saving output            | Building messages, filenames, buffers   |
| **Risk of overflow?**  | Yes (need to control input manually)       | No (size-limited by buffer you provide) |

---

## 💡 Bonus: `sprintf()` vs `snprintf()`

- **`sprintf()`** is like `snprintf()` but **doesn't limit the size** — which means it can **overflow** if you're not careful.
  
```c
char msg[50];
sprintf(msg, "Hi %s, score: %d", "Dipsana", 98); // ⚠️ Risky
```

- **`snprintf()`** lets you set a max buffer size — much safer!

```c
snprintf(msg, sizeof(msg), "Hi %s, score: %d", "Dipsana", 98); // ✅ Safe
```

> ✅ **Pro tip:** Always use `snprintf()` unless you *totally* control the output size.

# ✅ C011: Dynamic Memory, Stack vs Heap, and `void *` in C

---

## 1. 🏗️ What is Dynamic Memory Allocation?

- Allocates **memory at runtime** (while program is running).
- Useful when **memory size is unknown in advance**.
- Comes from the **Heap**, not the Stack.

| Allocation Type | Timing       | Memory Location |
| --------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| Static          | Compile-time | Stack           |

## 3. ⚙️ Dynamic Memory Functions

| Function       | Description                            |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `malloc(size)` | Allocates memory (garbage inside)      |
| `calloc(n,s)`  | Allocates + zeroes memory              |
| `realloc(p,s)` | Resizes previously allocated memory    |
| `free(ptr)`    | Frees the memory, prevents memory leak |

### 🧪 Quick Example

```c
// malloc example
int *p = (int *)malloc(5 * sizeof(int));

// calloc example
int *q = (int *)calloc(5, sizeof(int));

// realloc example
p = (int *)realloc(p, 10 * sizeof(int));

// free memory
free(p);
free(q);
```

## 4. 🌀 `void *` and the Magic of `*`

### 🔹 What is `void *`?

- A **generic pointer** returned by `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`.
- Holds the **address of any type**, but **type unknown**.

```c
int *p = (int *)malloc(5 * sizeof(int));  // cast to int*
```

### 🔹 What does `*` mean?

- `*` = pointer to something.
- `int *p` → p holds the **address of an `int`**.

📌 `malloc` gives you an **address** → You need `*` to **store that address** correctly.

## 5. ⚖️ Safe and Smart Allocation

### 🔍 Common mistake

```c
int *arr = malloc(n * sizeof(int)); // If you change arr’s type, you might forget this.
```

### ✅ Better way

```c
int *arr = malloc(n * sizeof(*arr)); // Safer!
```

> “Allocate space for `n` items of whatever type `arr` points to.”

🎯 Cleaner and **type-safe** even for `float`, `char`, `struct`, etc.

#### Example

```c
float *scores = malloc(n * sizeof(*scores));
```

## 6. 🚪 `exit()` – End the Program

- `exit(0);` → Ends successfully.
- `exit(1);` → Ends with error.
- Wherever called, it **immediately halts** program execution.

---

## 7. 🧼 Don't Forget `free()`

- Always `free()` what you `malloc()` / `calloc()` / `realloc()`.
- Else → memory stays occupied = **Memory Leak**.
- All these functions return `NULL` if allocation fails.

## 🔥 TL;DR Summary

| Concept     | Meaning                                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stack**   | Fast, automatic, small, temporary 💨               |
| **Heap**    | Manual, big, flexible, slower 🧩                   |
| **void \*** | Generic pointer – "I hold an address!" 🎯          |
| **\***      | Used to declare/store pointers (memory address) 💾 |
| **free()**  | Mandatory after dynamic allocation 💣              |

# PC002. Tips

## 💡 Tip 1

```c
char moves[] = {'r', 'p', 's'};
char comp = moves[rand() % 3];
```

You can **skip the array** and do:

```c
char comp = "rps"[rand() % 3];
```

➔ `"rps"` is a **string literal** (`const char[]`), so indexing it works the same.
➔ Think of it as a **temporary string** which is dissolved instantly.
➔ Saves a line and makes it look **even cleaner**!

## 💡 Tip 2

**Avoid recursion** for *continue-or-stop* programs — **use loops instead**!

Why?

| 🚫 Recursion                     | ✅ Loops                          |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Eats stack memory 💾             | Constant memory usage 🔁          |
| Risk of crash with long use 💥   | Safe for millions of runs 🛡️      |
| Harder to trace/debug 🧩         | Clear, linear flow 📜             |

➔ Recursion is **overkill** for simple input-based logic.  
➔ Use it only for **tiny programs**, **demos**, or **code golf** fun!
